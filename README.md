Clone the repository and start the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xw1030/phyres-site.git
cd phyres-site
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the local address shown in the terminal, normally:

## Main files

- `app/page.tsx` — website content and page structure
- `app/globals.css` — colours, typography and global styles
- `public/` — website images and visual assets
- `app/layout.tsx` — page metadata and global layout

## Build check

Before pushing a substantial change, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Editing workflow

1. Pull the latest `main` branch.
2. Create and test the changes locally.
3. Run the build check.
4. Commit the changes with a clear message.
5. Push to GitHub.

The hosted website is deployed separately from the GitHub repository. Pushing to GitHub updates the source code but does not by itself guarantee that the public website has been redeployed.
